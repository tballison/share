DEFINITIONS
1. IP Address: An Internet Protocol address (or simply “IP address”) is a

unique numeric address used by devices, such as computers, on the Internet. Every

device attached to the Internet must be assigned an IP address so that Internet traffic sent

from and directed to that device may be directed properly from its source to its

destination. Most Internet service providers control a range of IP addresses.

2. Server: A server is a computer that provides services for other computers
connected to it via a network or the Internet. The computers that use the server’s services
are sometimes called “clients.” Servers can be physically located anywhere with a
network connection that may be reached by the clients; for example, it is not uncommon
for a server to be located hundreds (or even thousands) of miles away from the client
computers. A server may be either a physical or virtual machine. A physical server is a
piece of computer hardware configured as a server with its own power source, central
processing unit/s and associated software. A virtual server is typically one of many |
servers that operate on a single physical server. Each virtual server shares the hardware
resources of the physical server but the data residing on each virtual server is segregated
from the data on other virtual servers that reside on the same physical machine.

3. Malware: Malware is malicious computer code running on a computer.
Relative to the owner/authorized user of that computer, malware is computer code that is
running on the system that is unauthorized and present on the system without the user’s
consent. Malware can be designed to do a variety of things, including logging every
keystroke on a computer, stealing financial information or “user credentials” (passwords
or usernames), or commanding that computer to become part of a network of “robot” or
“bot” computers known as.a “botnet.” In addition, malware can be used to transmit data
from the infected computer to another destination on the Internet, as identified by an IP
address. Often times, these destination IP addresses are computers controlled by
cybercriminals. |

4. The Carbanak malware: “Carbanak” is the name given by computer
security researchers to a particular malicious software (malware) program. Carbanak has
been used to remotely access computers without authorization. The Carbanak malware
allows an attacker to spy on another person’s computer and remotely control the
computer. Carbanak can record videos of the victim’s computer screen and send the

recordings back to the attacker. It can also let the attacker use the victim computer to

attack other computers, and to steal files from the victim computer, and install other
malware. All of this can be done without the legitimate user’s knowledge or permission.

5, Bot: A “bot” computer is a computer that has been infected with some kind
of malicious software or code and is thereafter subject to control by someone other than
the true owner. The true owner of the infected computer usually remains able to use the
computer as he did before it was infected, although speed or performance may be
compromised. |

6. Botnet: A “botnet” is a network of compromised computers known as
“bots” that are under the control of a cybercriminal or “bot herder.” The bots are
harnessed by the bot herder through the surreptitious installation of malware that provides
the bot herder with remote access to, and control of, the compromised computers. A
botnet may be used en masse, in a coordinated fashion, to deliver a variety of Internet-
based attacks, including DDoS attacks, brute force password attacks, the transmission of
spam emails, the transmission of phishing emails, and hosting communication networks
for cybercriminals (e.g., acting as a proxy server for email communications).

7. Phishing: Phishing is a criminal scheme in which the perpetrators use
mass email messages and/or fake websites to trick people into providing information such
as network credentials (e.g., usernames and passwords) that may later be used to gain
access to a victim’s systems. Phishing schemes often utilize social engineering
techniques similar to traditional con-artist techniques in order to trick victims into
believing they are providing their information to a trusted vendor, customer, or other
acquaintance. Phishing emails are also often used to trick a victim into clicking on
documents or links that contain malicious software that will compromise the victim’s
computer system.

8. Spear Phishing: Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing directed
towards a specific individual, organization or business. Although often intended to steal
data for malicious purposes, cybercriminals may also use spear phishing schemes to

install malware on a targeted user’s computer.

9. Social Engineering: Social engineering is a skill developed over time by
people who seek to acquire protected information through manipulation of social
relationships. People who are skilled in social engineering can convince key individuals
to divulge protected information or access credentials that the social engineer deems
valuable to the achievement of his or her aims.

10.  Pen-Testing: Penetration testing, or pen-testing, is the practice of testing a
computer system, network or computer application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker

may exploit.

custody and control of the financial institutions by means of materially false and
fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, in violation of Title 18, United States
Code, Section 1344(1) and (2).

Il. OBJECTIVES OF THE CONSPIRACY

13. The defendant, and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, were
part of a financially motivated cybercriminal conspiracy known variously as FIN7, the
Carbanak Group, and the Navigator Group (referred to herein as “FIN7”). FIN7 consists
of a group of criminal actors engaged in a sophisticated malware campaign targeting the
computer systems of businesses, primarily in the restaurant, gaming, and hospitality
industries, among others.

14. The objectives of the conspiracy included hacking into protected computer
networks using malicious software (hereinafter, “malware”) designed to provide the
conspirators with unauthorized access to, and control of, victim computer systems. The
objectives of the conspiracy further included conducting surveillance of victim computer
networks, and installing additional malware on victim computer networks for the
purposes of establishing persistence, and stealing money and property, including payment
card (e.g., credit and debit) track data, financial information, and proprietary and non-
public information. The objectives of the conspiracy further included using and selling
the stolen data and information for financial gain in a variety of ways, including, but not
limited to, using stolen payment card data to conduct fraudulent transactions across the
United States and in foreign countries.

III. MANNER AND MEANS OF THE CONSPIRACY
| 15. The manner and means used to accomplish the conspiracy included the
following: | |
a. FIN7 developed and employed various malware designed to
infiltrate, compromise, and gain control of the computer systems of victim companies

operating in the United States and elsewhere, including within the Western District of

Washington. FIN7 established and operated an infrastructure of servers, located in
various countries, through which FIN7 members coordinated activity to further the
scheme. This infrastructure included, but was not limited to, the use of command and
control servers, accessed through custom botnet control panels, that communicated with
and controlled compromised computer systems of victim companies.

b. FIN7 created a front company doing business as Combi Security to
facilitate the malware scheme by seeking to make the scheme’s illegal conduct appear
legitimate. Combi Security purports to operate as a computer security pen-testing
company based in Moscow, Russia and Haifa, Israel. As part of advertisements and
public internet pages for Combi Security, FIN7 portrayed Combi Security as a legitimate
penetration testing enterprise that hired itself out to businesses for the purpose of testing
their computer security systems.

c. Under the guise of a legitimate computer security company, FIN7,
doing business as Combi Security, recruited individuals with computer programming
skills, falsely claiming that the prospective employees would be engaged in legitimate
pen-testing of client computer networks. In truth and in fact, the defendant and his FIN7
co-conspirators well knew Combi Security was a front company used to hire and deploy
hackers who were given tasks in furtherance of the FIN7 conspiracy.

d. FIN7 targeted victims in the Western District of Washington, and
elsewhere, using phishing techniques to distribute malware designed to gain unauthorized
access to, take control of, and exfiltrate data from the computer systems of various
businesses. FIN7 has targeted hundreds of victim companies and brands, including, but
not limited to, the following representative victims:

1. “Victim-1” referenced herein is the Emerald Queen Hotel and
Casino (EQC), a hotel and casino owned and operated by a federally recognized Native

American Tribe with locations in Pierce County, within the Western District of

e. FIN7 typically initiated its attacks by delivering, directly and

through intermediaries, a phishing email with an attached malicious file, using wires in

Case 2:19-cr-00257-RSM Document5 Filed 12/12/19 Page 8 of 36

interstate and foreign commerce, to an employee of the targeted victim company. The
attached malicious file usually was a Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx), Google Docs, or
Rich Text File (.rtf) document with embedded malware. FIN7 used a variety of malware
delivery mechanisms in its phishing attachments including, but not limited to,
weaponized Microsoft Word macros, malicious Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)
objects, malicious visual basic scripts or JavaScript, and malicious embedded shortcut
files (LNK files). In some instances, the phishing email or attached file contained a link
to malware hosted on servers controlled by FIN7. The phishing email, through false
representations and pretenses, fraudulently induced the victim company employee to
open the attachment or click on the link to activate the malware. For example, when
targeting a hotel chain, the purported sender of the phishing email might falsely claim to
be interested in making a hotel reservation. By way of further example, when targeting a
restaurant chain, the purported sender of the phishing email might falsely claim to be
interested in placing a catering order or making a complaint about prior food service at
the restaurant.

f. In certain phishing attacks, FIN7, directly and through
intermediaries, sent phishing emails to personnel at victim companies who had unique
access to internal proprietary and non-public company information, including, but not
limited to, employees involved with making filings with the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These emails used an email address that spoofed an
email address associated with the SEC’s electronic filing system, and induced the
recipients to activate the malware contained in the emails’ attachments.

g. In many of the FIN7 attacks, a FIN7 member, or someone hired by
FIN7 specifically for such purpose, would also call the victim company, using wires in
interstate and foreign commerce, to legitimize the phishing email and convince the victim
company employee to open the attached document using social engineering techniques.
For example, when targeting a hotel chain or a restaurant chain, a conspirator would

make a follow-up call falsely claiming that the details of a reservation request, catering

order, or customer complaint could be found in the file attached to the previously
delivered email, to induce the employee at the victim company to read the phishing
email, open the attached file, and activate the malware.

h. If the recipient activated the phishing email attachment or clicked on
the link, the recipient would unwittingly activate the malware, and the computer on
which it was opened would become infected and connect to one or more command and
control servers controlled by FIN7 to report details of the newly infected computer and
download additional malware. The command and control infrastructure relied upon
various servers in multiple countries, including, but not limited to, the United States,
typically leased using false information, such as alias names and fictitious information.

1. FIN7 typically would install additional malware, including the
Carbanak malware, to connect to additional FIN7 command and control servers to
establish remote control of the victim computer.

j: Once a victim’s computer was compromised, FIN7 would
incorporate the compromised machine or “bot” into a botnet. .

k. FIN7 designed and used a custom botnet control panel to manage
and issue commands to the compromised machines.

I. Once a victim company’s computers were incorporated into the
FIN7 botnet and remotely controlled by FIN7’s malware, the group used this remote
control and access to, among other things, install and manage additional malware,
conduct surveillance, map and navigate the compromised computer network, compromise
additional computers, exfiltrate files, and send and receive data. For instance, FIN7 often
conducted surveillance on the victim’s computer network by, among other things,
capturing screen shots and videos of victim computer workstations that provided the
conspirators with additional information about the victim company computer network
and non-public credentials for both generic company accounts and for actual company

employees.

Case 2:19-cr-00257-RSM Document5 Filed 12/12/19 Page 10 of 36

m. _ FIN7 used its access to the victim’s computer network and
information gleaned from surveillance of the victim’s computer systems to install
additional malware designed to target and extract particular information and property of
value, including payment card data and proprietary and non-public information. For
instance, FIN7 often utilized various “off-the-shelf” software and custom malware, and a
combination thereof, to extract and transfer data to a “loot” folder on one or more servers
controlled by FIN7.

n. FIN7 frequently targeted victim companies with customers who use
payment cards while making legitimate point-of-sale (POS) purchases, such as victim
companies in the restaurant, gaming, and hospitality industries. In those cases, FIN7
configured malware to extract, copy, and compile the payment card data, and then to
transmit the data from the victim computer systems to servers controlled by FIN7.

oO. For example, between approximately March 24, 2017, and April 18,
2017, FIN7 harvested payment card data from point-of-sale devices at certain Victim-3
restaurant locations, including dozens of locations in the Western District of Washington.

p. FIN7 stole millions of payment card numbers, many of which have
been offered for sale through vending sites, including, but not limited to, Joker’s Stash,
thereby attempting to generate millions of dollars of illicit profits.

q. The payment card data were offered for sale to allow purchasers to
falsely represent themselves as authorized users of the stolen payment cards and to use
the stolen payment card information to purchase goods and services in fraudulent
transactions throughout the United States and the world, resulting in millions of dollars in
losses to, and thereby affecting, merchants and banks, including financial institutions, as
defined in Title 18, United States Code, Section 20. For example, on or about March 10,
2017, stolen payment card data related to accounts held at Victim-5, a financial
institution headquartered in the Western District of Washington, compromised through
the computer network intrusion of a victim company, was used to make unauthorized

purchases at a merchant in Puyallup, Washington.

r. FIN7 members employed various techniques to conceal their
identities, including simultaneously utilizing various leased servers that had been leased
using false subscriber information, in multiple countries.

S. FIN7 operated as a structured enterprise with a hierarchical
command structure under which dozens of members with diverse skillsets could
coordinate their malicious activity. Members of the scheme included, but were not
limited to:

1. Fedir Hladyr, a systems administrator who, among other
things, maintained servers and communication channels used by the organization. Fedir
Hladyr played a leading managerial role by delegating tasks and by providing instruction
to other members of the scheme.

il. Dmytro Fedorov, a high-level “pen-tester’’ who supervised
other hackers specifically tasked with breaching the security of victims’ computer
systems without the victims’ knowledge or consent.

iii. | Andrii Kolpakov, a high-level “pen-tester” who supervised
other hackers responsible for breaching the security of victims’ computer systems
without the victims’ knowledge or consent.

iv. DENYS IARMAK, a “pen-tester” who was tasked with
breaching the security of victims’ computer systems without the victims’ knowledge or
consent.

t. FIN7 members typically communicated with one another and others
through private communication channels to further their malicious activity. Among other
channels, FIN7 conspirators communicated using Jabber, an instant messaging service
that allows members to communicate across multiple platforms and that supports end-to-
end encryption.

u. For example, in Jabber communications with other FIN7 members,
Dmytro Fedorov, referenced using malware in connection with several specific victim

companies, discussed using the administrative control panels to receive data from

compromised computers, and identified several pen-testers working at his direction. By
way of further example, in a Jabber communication sent on or about October 26, 2017,
DENIS IARMAK provided Fedir Hladyr with internal system information that had been
stolen from a victim company, a U.S.-based restaurant chain.

V. FIN7 members often communicated through a private HipChat
server. HipChat is a group chat, instant messaging, and file-sharing program. FIN7
members used its HipChat server to collaborate on malware and victim business
intrusions, to interview potential recruits, and to upload and share exfiltrated data, such as
stolen payment card data. As a system administrator, Fedir Hladyr created HipChat user
accounts for FIN7 members that allowed them to access the server.

w. Fedir Hladyr also created and participated in multiple HipChat
“rooms” with other FIN7 members and participated in the uploading and organization of
stolen payment card data and malware. For example, on or about March 14, 2016, Fedir
Hladyr uploaded an archive that contained numerous data files created by malware
designed to steal data from point-of-sale systems that process payment cards. The files
contained payment card numbers stolen from a victim company that had publicly
reported a security breach that resulted in the compromise of tens of thousands of
payment cards. By way of further example, Fedir Hladyr also set up and used a HipChat
room titled “MyFile”, in which he was the only participant, and to which he uploaded
malware used by FIN7 and stolen payment card information.

Xx. FIN7 conspirators used numerous email accounts hosted by a variety
of providers in the United States and elsewhere, which they often registered using false
subscriber information.

y. FIN7 conspirators frequently used the project management software
JIRA, hosted on private virtual servers in various countries, to coordinate their malicious
activity and to manage the assorted network intrusions. JIRA is a project management
and issue-tracking program used by software development teams. FIN7 members

typically created a “project” on the virtual JIRA server and then associated “issues” with

the project, each issue akin to an issue directory or folder, for a victim company, which
they used to collaborate and share details of the intrusion, to post victim company
intelligence, such as network mapping information, and to store and share exfiltrated
data.

Z. For example, on about September 7, 2016, Fedir Hladyr created an
“issue” for Victim-6, to which FIN7 conspirators including Andreii Kolpakov posted files
containing internal credentials for the victim company’s computer network.

aa. By way of further example, on multiple occasions in January 2017,
Dmytro Fedorov and another FIN7 member posted to the FIN7 “issue” created for

Victim-7, information about the victim company’s internal network and uploaded

|| exfiltrated data, including stolen employee credentials. Similarly, on or about April 5,

2017, Dmytro Fedorov created an “issue” for another victim company, Victim-9, and
uploaded stolen user credentials from the victim company. DENIS IARMAK had access
to approximately 25 JIRA issues on one FIN7 server, and approximately 20 JIRA issues
on another FIN7 server.

bb. — FIN7 conspirators knew that the scheme would involve the use of
wires in both interstate and foreign commerce to accomplish the objectives of the
scheme. For example, each defendant and his FIN7 co-conspirators knew that execution
of the scheme necessarily caused the transmission of wire communications between the
United States and one or more servers controlled by FIN7 located in foreign countries.

All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1349.

1. SCHEME AND ARTIFICE TO DEFRAUD

17. Beginning at a time unknown, but no later than September 2015, and
continuing through on or after December 12, 2019, at Seattle, within the Western District
of Washington, and elsewhere, the defendant, DENYS IARMAK, and others known and
unknown to the Grand Jury, devised and intended to devise a scheme and artifice to
defraud and to obtain money and property by means of materially false and fraudulent
pretenses, representations and promises.

18. | The essence of the scheme and artifice to defraud was to obtain
unauthorized access into, and control of, the computer networks of victims through deceit
and materially false and fraudulent pretenses and representations, through the installation
and use of malware designed to facilitate, among other things, the installation of
additional malware, the sending and receiving of data, and the surveillance of the
victims’ computer networks. The object of the scheme and artifice to defraud was to
steal money and property of value, including payment card data and proprietary and non-
